# Project: Skincare Store Management System

This project showcases a **Skincare Store Management System** built using **Flask**, a lightweight web framework.  
While Flask is not as dynamic as Django, it is a great starting point for web development.  
The system is connected to a **MySQL database** to store and manage data such as products, customers, orders, and more.
